# Movies-ETL

## Purpose of Project
Amazing Prime Video is a video streaming service that is trying to predict what low-budget movies would successful on their service, so that they can buy the rights to these for reasonable prices.  A dataset obtained by scraping Wikipedia, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data has been provided.  Amazing Prime has requested an automated pipeline that takes in new movie data, transforms the data into a useable format, and loads it into existing tables in a database.  Using Jupyter Notebook, various modules in Python, and PostgreSQL database, the algorithm created to extract, transform and load the original data has been refactored to perform the ETL process daily on all new movie data.
